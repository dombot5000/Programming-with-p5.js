  background(0); //by putting backgroun in setup it the background become a chalkboard
}

  //background(0); //define colour using RGB
  noStroke();
  fill(255, 50) //50 add opacity to the line being drawn
  //fill(mouseY) //colour of object changes with mouseY position
  ellipse(circleX, circleY, circleS); // mouseX Y makes the object follow the mouse
  circleX = circleX + 0.4 // assignment operation right hand sign evaluated
  //makes x of ellipse move
  circleY = circleY + 0.4 // makes Y of ellipse move
  circleS = circleS + 0.1 // makes ellipse grow
}

function mousePressed() { //when clicked it resets to a blank canvas
  background(0);
